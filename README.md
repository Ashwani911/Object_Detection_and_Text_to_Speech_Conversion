# Object_Detection_and_Text_to_Speech_Conversion
The Object Detection and Text-to-Speech Conversion project uses the YOLO algorithm to detect and classify objects in real time, then converts labels into speech with gTTS and plays audio output. It enhances accessibility, especially for the visually impaired, and has applications in assistive tech, robotics, and smart surveillance.
